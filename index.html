      I'm a Site Reliability Engineer currently working at Athens/Greece.<br> 
		 Besides my daily work, I spend my time on hacking, gaming and fishing.<br><br>
		 My gaming journey started with Ultima Online and Knight Online, after those two I've met with Dota and WoW. For now, Dota 2 and Wow are the two games that I spend my gaming time the most.<br>
		 Fishing passion is coming from my willing to chill and stay calm. The time I spend for fishing simply is a therapy.<br>
		 Also my interest/love in hacking started with games. After I played lots of them, I've started making them. Then I realize creating is fun, but breaking is more fun.<br>
		 That was the time I started doing some research and found bug bounties. I was trying to find any information, person or report I can learn anything. And as a beginner that times, I've found Ben Sadeghipour (@nahamsec) and started reading his findings, disclosed reports and watching his streams/videos.<br>
		 After practicing, I've started to find bugs on real targets. Below you can find my list of Hall of Fame's.        </p>
